# topsismdcm
This is a C++ implementation of the TOPSIS algorithm — a widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. It helps rank alternatives (such as factory sites, products, or options) based on multiple weighted parameters with positive or negative impact.

Features:
Takes user-defined options and evaluation parameters
Supports both benefit (+) and cost (−) criteria
Normalizes data and applies custom weights
Calculates ideal best & worst solutions
Outputs final rankings based on closeness to ideal

Use cases:
Location selection (e.g., factory, warehouse)
Product or vendor comparison
Any scenario requiring decision-making based on multiple criteria

Built using:
C++
Standard Template Library (STL)
Terminal formatting for better readability

HOW IT WORKS!!
TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest the Euclidean distance from the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal solution.

Note from me
The code is super readable and you can understand what the hell is going on without having to go through tons of documentation!
